- [x] Update the table for Holland (planned for [[tag/liblouis2.6]])
- [ ] Find out how we can eventually merge the tables for Belgium and
  Holland. We might not manage this before 2.6 because we need to
  coordinate with CBB and PHK.

see [pull request 16](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/pull/16)

The new Dutch table was merged. The actual combining of the two tables
is left for later, see
[issue 16](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/issues/34).
