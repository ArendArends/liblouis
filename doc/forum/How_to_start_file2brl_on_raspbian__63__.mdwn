Okay, I feel stupid asking this but I am at about the end of my rope and I just want a clear answer.
I have installed liblouis and liblouisutdml onto a raspberry pi.

NOW, someone, just very clearly, explain to me how i run file2brl?
I ask because the by reading the manual it makes it seem like I would just need put in the terminal "file2brl [options] infile outfile" but that does not seem to work.

Please help!
